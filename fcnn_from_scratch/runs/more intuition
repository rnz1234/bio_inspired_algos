it looks like at this point (run#14+):
- when I make the hidden layer wider the number of epochs for accuracy level decreases
- when I make the hidden layer wider it runs slower
Need to stay in the area of 512-1024 nuerons, maybe closer to 512 is better and run more epochs
-----------------------------
After running 512 for 1500 epochs, I can say : better run 1024 for 600 epochs
and maybe better making it bigger
